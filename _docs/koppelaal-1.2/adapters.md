# Adapters




[[TOC]]

Adapters are main building blocks of the Koppeltaal architecture. As the main protocol is FHIR/Koppeltaal the adapters induces an abstraction layer that helps quick development. Each adapter is build for a specific programming language (C#, Python, PHP, Java, Android, iOS, JS) and moves the Koppeltaal FHIR REST API into specific implementation language. 

Questions and answers: 

1. What can an Adapter offer as added value?  implementing the REST API Calls and Koppeltaal specific protocol into a dedicated programming language library.
2. What do I need to do to get an adapter for my need? A subscription to Koppeltaal and access to Koppeltaal GIT. 
3 What is maturity level of the adapters? Adapters are community projects so the level of maturity depends on their usage. An adapter that is largely used has more functionality then an adapter that is less used. A maturity matrix is provided here. 

The following message types are available as part of the Adapter implementation. 


| API call     | Description | Documentation   |
| :------- | ----: | :---: |
|   Get next message and claim | Retrieves the first unread message and marks it as claimed.|     |
|   Search for message id    | Gets the message with the given id, regardless of its status.   |     |
|  Updating the Processing Status for a Message     | Updates the status of the given message.  |    |
|   Retrieve activity definitions    | An activity definition describes an activity that is made available by a Device   |    |
|    Storage Service AP   | POST PUT GET & DELETE for item management    |    |
