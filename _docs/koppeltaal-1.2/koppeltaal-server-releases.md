## 1.1.0
- When I send an update ActivityDefinition with less SubActivities to the the Koppeltaal Server, the one no longer existing are not actually deleted or marked as no longer active, causing the Koppeltaal Server to be out-of-date.
- As a Koppeltaal customer I want to be able to create an Organization and link Practitioners to it, and link the CarePlan to the Organization instead of the individual Practitioners, this way creating more stability in the data exchanged.
- When 2 application instances, send an ActivityDefinition that are Domain-specific with the same Identifier in their own domain, the second one gets a duplicate key failure. The same happens when you try to do that through the management portal. Bottom line, the Identifier cannot be defined as a unique key across all domains.
- As a Koppeltaal Application, I want to use a refresh token to secure my authentication, and no longer allow an Authorization Request to be used more than one time.
- As a Koppeltaal customer I want to be able to search for MessageHeaders using the MessageHeader identifier instead of having to parse the ID from the selflink.
- As a koppeltaal customer I want to be able to register the Demo portal for a specific server and domain
- As a Koppeltaal customer I want to have the possibility to get a activation code for a mobile client in the Practitioner/Patient portal

## 1.0.1

- As a Koppeltaal customer I want ActivityDefinition to have the attributes DefaultSubmitter with options Patient, RelatedPerson and Practitioner and a boolean indicating if the ActivityDefinition still active.
- As a Koppeltaal customer I want to be able to publish (changes in) the activity definitions that are available. (Implementation)
- As a Koppeltaal customer I want to be able to send the CreateOrUpdatePractitioner messages via the VH Koppeltaal Client.
- As a Koppeltaal customer I want to be able to send the CreateOrUpdateRelatedPerson messages via the VH Koppeltaal Client.
- As a Koppeltaal customer I want to be able to send the CreateOrUpdatePatient messages via the VH Koppeltaal Client.
