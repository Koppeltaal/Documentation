# Koppeltaal Documention Repository

_This repository is very much work in progress and might not even be the definite solution._

This repository collects and publishes the technical documentation for the Koppeltaal message format, resource definitions, extensions and Koppeltaal Server features and interactions.

This documentation is published from the master branch to [https://koppeltaal.github.io/documentation/](https://koppeltaal.github.io/documentation/)

The documentation infrastructure is based on [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). Is uses the CloudCannon [Edition](https://github.com/CloudCannon/edition-jekyll-template) theme and templates.

In order to locally build and "serve" the documentation, you need to set up Jekyll.

The "sources" of the documentation reside in the `_docs` subdirectory. They can be written in Markdown \(`.md` file extension\) or in plain HTML \(`.html` file extension\). When changes are committed and then pushed to the master branch of the documentation repository, GitHub Pages will build the build the pages. Build error will be emailed to the most recent committer.
